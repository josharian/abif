Package abif provides an ABIF file reader, for use with Applied Biosystems (and compatible) sequencers.

This was a quick-and-dirty implementation to get myself off the ground.
There are open API questions, and there is little question that the code could be improved.

I would be delighted if someone hijacked it, finished it, and claimed it as their own.
